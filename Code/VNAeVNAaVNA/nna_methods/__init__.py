        Nearest Neighbor Averaging (NNA) object is designed to support 2D
        neighbor based interpolation. It is designed in the scikit-learn style,
        with fit and predict methods. It is not part of the scikit-learn
        package. Perhaps one day. Currently, supports:

        * Several Neighbor Selection Methods
          * Nearest Neighbors (k-nearest)
          * Voronoi neighbors from k-nearest
        * Alternative Neighbor Weights
          * distance power weightings (e.g., d**-2)
          * Laplace weightings for Voronoi
        * Leave one out (loo) prediction for simple cross validation

        Basic Usage:

            nn = NNA()
            nn.fit(X, z)
            zhat = nn.predict(X)

        The predict method has keywords that support multiple neighbor
        selection methods and weights. See help(NNA.predict) for more details.
        An example below, creates synthetic data, fits and predicts with three
        alternative methods and prints the RMSE for each.

        Example Usage:

            import numpy as np
            import nna_methods

            # create synthetic data
            n = 90
            x = np.arange(n, dtype='f')
            X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, x)
            Z = X * 5 + Y * 10 + 20
            XY = np.array([X.ravel(), Y.ravel()]).T

            # Random subsample of space
            xy = np.array([
                np.random.randint(n, size=n),
                np.random.randint(n, size=n)
            ]).T
            z = Z[xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1]]

            # Fit xy to z once
            nn = nna_methods.NNA()
            nn.fit(xy + 1e-6, z)

            # Reconstruct image using different methods
            for method in ['nearest', 'voronoi', 'laplace']:
              Zhat = nn.predict(XY, method=method, k=30).reshape(Z.shape)
              rmse = ((np.ma.masked_invalid(Zhat) - Z)**2).mean()**.5
              print(method, rmse)

        All keyword arguments are used as defaults in predict.

        Notes

        Added in version 0.4.0

            A = first guess
            for r in rs:
                # i where d_i < r

        s_i is an addition to Glahn that allows for weighting of individual
            observations. This allows combining, for example, regulatory grade
            observations with low-cost sensors
